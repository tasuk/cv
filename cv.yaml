    - My CV is generated into both the [HTML version]() and the [PDF version](cv-vit-brunner.pdf) from a [YAML source](cv.yaml) (you can [see the code on github](http://github.com/tasuk/cv)). I think that's pretty cool. If you think so too, I would like to work with you!

    Philosophy:
        - Strive to write elegant code.
        - Go great lengths to avoid any form of code duplication.
        - Don't care for tabs versus spaces, underscores versus camelCase, etc. but have a coding standard in place and follow it.
        - Normalize relational databases as far as performance concerns allow.
        - Microsoft sucks, use \*nix, shell, vim.
