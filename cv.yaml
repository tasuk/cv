    Personal philosophy:
        - Communication is the key.
        - Strive to write elegant code. Avoid any form of code duplication.
        - Continuous integration is a necessity. Integration tests are more useful than unit tests. Don't care for tabs vs. spaces, under_scores vs. camelCase etc, but enforce a coding standard.
        - Normalize relational databases as far as performance concerns allow.
        - Prefer simple tools. Use *nix, shell, vim.
