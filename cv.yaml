    Philosophy:
        - Strive to write elegant code.
        - Go great lengths to avoid any form of code duplication.
        - Don't care for tabs versus spaces, underscores versus camelCase, etc. but have a coding standard in place and follow it.
        - Normalize relational databases as far as performance concerns allow.
        - Microsoft sucks, use *nix, shell, vim.
