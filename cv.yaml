    Manifesto:
        - I despise any form of code duplication, and will go great lengths to avoid it. I don't care much for tabs versus spaces, underscores versus camelCase, but consider it vitally important that a coding standard is in place and being followed. (Relational) databases should be normalized, as far as performance concerns allow. Many-to-many tables should use logical key as primary. I don't like Windows, give me bash, screen and vim, and I'll be happy. I strive to write elegant code.
