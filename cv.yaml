    - My CV is generated into both the [HTML version]() and the [PDF version](cv-vit-brunner.pdf) from a [YAML source](cv.yaml) (you can [see the source on github](http://github.com/tasuk/cv)). I think that's pretty cool. If you also think that, I might like to work for you!

    Manifesto:
        - I will go great lengths to avoid any form of code duplication.
        - I don't care much for tabs versus spaces, underscores versus camelCase, &c. but consider it vitally important that a coding standard is in place and being followed.
        - (Relational) databases should be normalized, as far as performance concerns allow.
        - I don't particularly care for Windows; give me bash, screen, and vim, and I'll be happy.
        - I strive to write elegant code.
