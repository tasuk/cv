    Personal projects:
        "[Minotaur](https://github.com/tasuki/minotaur)":
            - 2016; *Scala*
            - An [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)-based AI to play [Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor). I can beat it.

            - 2014; *AngularJS, CoffeeScript*
            - Easy visual comparison tool for different translations or versions of itemized texts; e.g. poems, bibles, etc. See it in action for [Enchiridion](https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/) and [Tao Te Ching](https://ttc.tasuki.org/).
        "[Zlej Rob](https://github.com/tasuki/zlej-rob)":
            - 2013; *Python*
            - A semi-intelligent AI solver for [RoboZZle](http://www.robozzle.com). Solved 2,000+ puzzles. Currently in top 50 of the 50,000+ players. This was lots of fun.

            - 2012; *JavaScript, jQuery*
            - A jQuery plugin to keep elements in jQuery Masonry ordered. This solved a problem I turned out not to have, but some people still use it.

            - 2008; *an awful MySQL database hiding behind one large PHP file*

            - Created PDFs containing go problems gathered from various sources. A couple of years later, designed a website powered by Middleman and Twitter Bootstrap.

    Cool things I've done:
        - Translated [KGS](http://www.gokgs.com/) and its client software from English into Czech.
        - Achieved [4 dan in the game of go](http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=12513842), studied in South Korea for three months under kind guidance of Mr Kim Sung-Rae, 8 dan professional.
        - Initiated and co-organized [Polish Summer Go Camp](http://lsg.go.art.pl) 2010 (around 90 participants throughout two weeks). Repeated the endeavour in 2016 with great success, introducing many improvements (more teachers for different grades, better tournament structure, play currency to bid for prizes).
        - Achieved advanced proficiency in certain [abstract board games](http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=5460), particularly TwixT, Hex, and Amazons.
        - Cycled across Europe, following the [Eurovelo 6](http://www.eurovelo6.org/) for two months from the Atlantic to the Black Sea.
        - Successfully completed several online courses; one of the first MOOCs -- [the AI-Class](certificates/2011-ai.pdf), [How Things Work](certificates/2013-how-things-work.pdf), [A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior](certificates/2013-irrational.pdf), [A Brief History of Humankind](certificates/2014-humankind.pdf), and [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Started and haven't finished many more.
        - Both the [HTML version](https://cv.tasuki.org) and the [PDF version](https://cv.tasuki.org/cv-vit-brunner.pdf) of my CV are generated from a [YAML source](https://cv.tasuki.org/cv.yaml). I think that's cool. If you think so too, I'd like to work with you!
